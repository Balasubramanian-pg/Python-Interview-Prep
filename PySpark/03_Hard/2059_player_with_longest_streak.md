2. **PySpark Optimization Strategy**:
   - Utilize native DataFrame API transformations (`select`, `filter`, `groupBy`, `withColumn`) to allow the Catalyst Optimizer to optimize query execution plans.
   - If ranking or windowed calculations are needed, define explicit partition keys and order expressions using `pyspark.sql.window.Window`.
   - Avoid collecting large DataFrames to the driver node; utilize distrib
